inter-intergrated circuit (I2C) protocol

2 Lines
1. SCL: Serial Clock
	> for synchronizing data transfer between the master and the slave
2. SDA: Serial Data
	> the data line
	
Operation Modes:
	1. master transmitter
	2. master receiver
	3. slave transmitter
	4. slave receiver
	(flexible)
	
Protocol (remember these points - how these line work)
	> transactions are initiated and completed by the master
	> all messages have an address frame and a data frame
	> data is placed on the sda line after SCL goes low, and it is sampled after the SCL line goes high

	
start and stop condition in: protocol_start_stop.png
SDA high to low and SCL is high = start
SDA low to high and SCL high  = stop
start and stop are set be master
bus is only free after stop condition, bus stays busy if STart instead of stop


protocol- byte format
	> 8 bit long
	> number of bytes transmitted per transfer is unrestricted
	> each byte is followed by ACK bit (acknowledge)
	> data is transferred with MSB first (most sig bit)

protocol - address
	> address frame is the first
	> MSB = address, followed by R/W
	> data frame is placed afetr this


I1C clock speed (speed of interface)
	> corresponds with bus speeds

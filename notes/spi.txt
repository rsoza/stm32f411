Searial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Protocol

- Synchronous and full-duplex communication between a master and several slave devices
	> communication goes both way hence (FULL-DUPLEX)
- uses two pins for data transfer-SDIN and SDO
- There is a SCLK pin to synchronize data transfer between two chips
- There is also a CE pin which is used to initate and terminate the data transfer
- Four pins total: check out spi_pin_names.png

Pin Functions:
		MOSI: SDI:	Master out Slave In
			> sends data from master to slave		
		MISO: SDO:	Master in slave out
			> sends data from slave to master
		SCK:  SCLK: Serial Clock
			> genertes clock to synchronize data transfer between the master and slave
			> generated by the master
		SS:	  CE:	Slave Select
			> selects a particular slave in the SPI multiple slaves configuration

- Unlike I2C, SPI slaves have no address
- checkout data flow: spi_slave_transfer.png
- checkout transmission: spi_slave_transmission.png
	> every rising edge data is transmitted
	
Clock phase and polarity
- Master and slave must agree on clock phase and polarity
- CPOL: clock polarity
- CPHAL clock phase
- Combinations of CPOL and CPHA are referred to as SPI bus modes

There are four modes based on CPOL and CPHAL:
			CPOL 			CPHA
	MODE0	  0				  0
	MODE1	  0				  1
	MODE2	  1				  0
	MODE3	  1				  1


CPOL = 0 		means sampling on the first edge
CPOL = 1		means sampling on the second edge


Other configuration params: NSS Management and TI mode

- NSS software mode: SS line is driven internally by the firmware
- NSS hardware mode: a dedicated GPIO pin is used to drive the SS line
- NSS mode needs to be used while in TI mode

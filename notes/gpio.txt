Section 2: General Purpose Input/Ouput


Interfacing
- MCU pins are grouped into PORT
	PA1: Port A Pin 1
- GPIO can be configured to perform special functions
- Special purpose input/output (SPIO)

Common Registers in MCU GPIO modules:
- at least 2 registers:
	1. direction register: sets as input or output, aka mode register
	2. data register: write or read to the pin
	
Two types of buses:
1. Advanced High Performance Bus (AHB)
	- newer bus
	- faster
	- 1 clock cycle to acces peripheral
2. Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB)
	- minimum of 2 clock cycles access to peripherals

MCU Clock Sources
1. On-Chip RC (Resister/capacitor) Oscillator
	- least precise
2. Externally Connected Crystal
	- most precise
3. Phase Locked Loop (PLL)
	- programmable

IDR is for input while ODR is for output

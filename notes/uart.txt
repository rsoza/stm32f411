Universal Asynchronous Reveiver/Transmitter (UART)

Parallel communication
- 8 bit data is transferred the same time

Searial communication
- 8 bit data is transferred one bit at a time
- UART is a serial communication device
- uses two methods:
	1. synchronous:
		> clock is transmitted with data
	2. asynchronous
		> not clock is transmitted
		> baudrate: transmitter and receiver agree on the clock speed for the data transmission
			need to figure out the clock rate for both
				- connection speed expressed in bits per second
			
USART: Universal synchronous asynchronous receiver/transmitter

Transmission Modes:
specifies whether RX or TX mode is enabled or disabled
1. Duplex: data can be transmitted and received
2. Simplex: Data can be transmitted only or received only; one direction
3. half duplex: data can be transmitted in only one way at a time
4. full duplex: data can be transmitted in both ways at a time


Protocol Summary:

in asynchronous transmission each byte (character) is packed between start and stop bits

- Start bit = 1 bit; the value of is alway 0
- Stop bit: can be 1 or 2 bits; value is always 1

allow the communication protocol to know where it starts and stop

Configuration Parameters:
- Baudrate
- Stop bit
- Parity: indicates even or odd for error checking
- mode
- Word lenth: specifies the number of data transmitted or received can by 8 or 9 bits
- Hardware flow control: specifies whether hardware flow control is enabled or disabled






CODDDINGGG::: 5_uart_tx

- stm32 has a USART found in the block diagram in datasheet
- USART2 will be the one we use because it is connected to the USB having a RX and TX pin
- USART2 is conencted to the APB1 bus
- in reference manual look for APB1ENR 
- in datasheet look for alternate function mapping
	> this lists all the port and pins that can be traced
	> here we find the USART_TX we need to enable PA2 under column AF07 which needs to be configured to an alternate function mode: AF07
- go to control regist 1 for USART_CR1 to set configurations in ref manual

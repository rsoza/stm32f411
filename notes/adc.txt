Analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
	- widely used devices for data acquisition
	- ex temp, velocity, 
	- converts physical quantity to electrical signals using a transducer (voltage or current)


ADC has n bit resolution
	- 8, 10, 12, 16 bit
	- higher resolution ADC has smaller step size
	- step size is the smallest change that can be detected by an ADC
	- ex 8bit = 256 steps = 5v/256 =19.53mV step size
				5v = reference voltage


ADC Independent Modes:
	- Single-channel, single conversion mode	
		> simplest ADC mode
		> ADV performs a single connversion of a single channel x and stops after conversion is complete
		> start -> convert channel -> stop
		> measurement of voltage level to determine if a system should start or not
		> needs to be checked once
		
	- Multichannel(scan), single conversion mode
		> used to convert multiple channels successively
		> up tp 16 different channels with different sampling times can be convertered on the STM32F4
		> start-> sample x -> convert channel -> stop
		> measurement of multiple sensors to determine whether a system should start or not
		
	- Single-channel continuous conversaion mode
		> used to convert a single channel continuously
		> works in the background without intervention from the CPU
		> measurement of temp to continuously adjust the temp appropriately
		> start -> convert channel -> start
		> measurement of room temp continuously to adjust air-conditioner
		
	- Multichannel continuous conversion mode
		> used to convert multiple channels continuously
		> up to 16 different channels with different sampling times can be converted on the ATM32F4
		> countinuously measuring multiple accelerometers to adjust joints of a robotic arm.
	
	- Injected continuous conversion mode
		> intended for use when conversion is triggered by an external event or by software
		> for synchronizing the conversion of channels to an event
		> the injected conversion mode interrupts the current moode
		> not as popular as the others
		
		
	**stm32f4 has a single adc module does not mean its one channel
	
	


ADC1 is the only one available in STM32 - datasheet block diagram
- in ref manual apb2enr: bit 8 is for the adc
- a microcontroller has one 16 bit ADC sharing 16 external channels
- table 8 shows additional functions: look for ADC channel 1

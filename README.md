# Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming Ground Up™ (STM32) Udemy Course Repository

This is documenting my progress and notes as I journey through the **Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming Ground Up™ (STM32)** course on Udemy. This README will provide an overview of the course and how I'm organizing my materials.

## Course Overview

The **Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming Ground Up™ (STM32)** course on Udemy is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of embedded systems programming using STM32 microcontrollers. It covers topics ranging from basic concepts to advanced techniques in bare-metal programming.

Throughout the course, we will explore:

- Introduction to Embedded Systems
- Overview of STM32 Microcontrollers
- Setting up Development Environment
- Bare-Metal Programming Concepts
- Peripheral Interfacing
- Interrupts and Timers
- Memory Management
- Debugging Techniques
- Project Implementation and Real-world Applications

## Repository Structure

In this repository, you'll find my progress and notes organized as follows:

- **Notes/**: This directory contains my detailed notes on each section or lecture of the course. These notes include key concepts, code snippets, and personal insights.
  
- **Projects/**: Here, I'll store the projects and implementations I develop throughout the course.

- **Code/**: This directory holds the code examples and exercises provided in the course. I'll also include my own implementations and modifications as I progress.
  
- **Resources/**: Any additional resources such as datasheets, reference manuals, or supplementary materials related to the course will be stored here.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the contents of this repository as I make progress through the course. If you're also enrolled in the same course or interested in embedded systems programming with STM32 microcontrollers, you may find the notes, projects, and code examples useful for your own learning journey.
